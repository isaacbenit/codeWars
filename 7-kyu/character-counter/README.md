Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same number of occurrences. You will return <code>true</code> if it is valid, or <code>false</code> if it is not.</p><p>For this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: <code>"A" == "a"</code> </p><p>The input is a string (with no spaces) containing <code>[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]</code> and common symbols. The length will be <code>0 &lt; length &lt; 100</code>.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><ul><li><code>"abcabc"</code> is a valid word because <code>"a"</code> appears twice, <code>"b"</code> appears twice, and<code>"c"</code> appears twice.  </li><li><code>"abcabcd"</code> is <strong>NOT</strong> a valid word because <code>"a"</code> appears twice, <code>"b"</code> appears twice, <code>"c"</code> appears twice, but <code>"d"</code> only appears once!  </li><li><code>"123abc!"</code> is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.</li></ul>
